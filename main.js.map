The same colors from [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations/color) are used.\\n\\n### Filter Pane\\n\\nThe Filters pane is set to the following values:\\n- **Width**: 250px\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-400 `#708090`\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Font (title)**: Segoue UI, 12pt\\n- **Font (headers)**: Segoe UI, 10pt\\n- **Font (search)**: 10pt\\n- **Border**: slate-gray-300 `#c0c5cc`\\n- **Input box background**: charcoal-blue `#384655`\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">\\n\\n![Filter Pane](./assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-filter-pane.png \\\"Filter Pane\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Filter Cards: Available\\n\\nFilter cards that are available to users are formatted as follows:\\n- **Background**: charcoal-blue `#384655`\\n- **Input box background**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Border**: slate-gray-300 `#c0c5cc`\\n- **Font**: Segoe UI, 9pt\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n\\n### Filter Cards: Applied\\n\\nFilters actively being used within the dashboard, page, or an object, are formatted in filter cards as follows:\\n- **Background**: gray-200 `#e0e0e0`\\n- **Input box background**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Border**: slate-gray-300 `#c0c5cc`\\n- **Font**: Segoe UI, 9pt\\n- **Font color**: offblack `#333333`\\n\\n##### Filter Scope\\n\\nPower BI divides filters on the filters pane by their scope.\\nSome filters, when set, should carry across application from one page to the next.\\nThese are grouped together in a section titled **Filters on all pages**.\\n\\nOther filters may only apply to the specific page the user is viewing, and will not carry over to other pages.\\nThese are grouped together in a section titled **Filters on this page**.\\n\\nThe section titles are formatted as:\\n- **Font**: Segoe (Bold)\\n- **Font size**: 10pt\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Background**: charcoal-blue `#384655`\\n\\nSome filters may only apply to the specific visual the user is viewing. These are grouped in a section within the filters pane titled **Filters on this visual**. You may also consider placing a slicer object next to the visual.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Advanced Filters\\n\\n![Advanced Filters](./assets/analytics/tableau/advancedfilters.png \\\"Advanced Filters\\\")\\n\\nThe filters pane should be the primary mechanic for filtering that most users leverage.\\nHowever, there may be power users of your accelerator who require the ability to define more precise or detailed cohorts.\\nFor those users, you may want to include an \\\"Advanced Filters\\\" page that includes a wider array of filter options.\\n\\nFrom a UX perspective, the risk with a page like this is that a user will define filters and then forget they turned them on.\\nThat's why we want to limit this page primarily to power users.\\nYou can link to it via an icon in the navbar (use the *AdvancedFilters.svg* image included with the template), which keeps it somewhat hidden for typical users.\\n\\nOn the Advanced Filters page, arrange the available filters into tiles as defined in the [Foundations section](/analytics/powerbi-foundations).\\n\\n:::\\n\";","export default \"# Chief Quality Officer\\n\\n###### Last updated Nov 30, 2020\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<div class=\\\"persona-header\\\">\\n\\n![Avatar Image](./assets/avatars/avatar78.svg)\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n# David Rodriguez\\n\\nOversees overall Patient Safety and Quality efforts with the hospital.

The only situation where a colon\n                should not be used is when the label and control work together to form a single sentence.\n            </p>\n            <div style=\"max-width: 300px; margin-top: 35px;\">\n                <hc-form-field>\n                    <hc-label>Hospital department:</hc-label>\n                    <hc-select placeholder=\"Select a department\">\n                        <option>Emergency department</option>\n                        <option>Cardiology</option>\n                        <option>Intensive care unit</option>\n                    </hc-select>\n                </hc-form-field>\n            </div>\n    </hc-tile>\n\n    <hc-tile>\n        <h5>Font Size</h5>\n        <p>\n            The default font of the body is\n            <code>14px</code> and all other font sizes are based off that using\n            <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size#Rems\">rems</a> or relative ems that are relative the the font size of the html element.\n        </p>\n        <table class=\"hc-table\">\n            <thead>\n                <tr>\n                    <th>px Size</th>\n                    <th>rem</th>\n                </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>8px</td>\n                    <td>0.5714rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>9px </td>\n                    <td>0.6429rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>10px</td>\n                    <td>0.7143rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>11px</td>\n                    <td>0.7857rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>12px</td>\n                    <td>0.8571rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>13px</td>\n                    <td>0.9286rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>14px\n                        <strong>(base)</strong>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>1rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>15px</td>\n                    <td>1.071rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>16px</td>\n                    <td>1.143rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>20px</td>\n                    <td>1.429rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>22px </td>\n                    <td>1.571rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>24px</td>\n                    <td>1.714rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>32px</td>\n                    <td>2.286rem</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>36px</td>\n                    <td>2.571rem</td>\n                </tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    </hc-tile>\n\n    <hc-tile>\n        <h5 id=\"sass-text-utilities\">Sass Text Utilities</h5>\n        <p> Save yourself the trouble of looking up or recalculating rem sizes using the\n            <code>fontSize()</code> sass mixin.</p>\n        <pre><code>@import &#39;../node_modules/cashmere/sass/cashmere&#39;;\n.some-class {{ '{' }}\n    @include fontSize(16px); // generates font-size: 1.143rem;\n{{ '}' }}</code></pre>\n    </hc-tile>\n\n    <hc-feedback-form></hc-feedback-form>\n</div>\n","export default \"# Error Pages\\n\\n###### Last updated Jan 9, 2019\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Overview\\n\\nOne of the most common errors users can come across while working with web apps is a 404 or Page Not Found error. This error often occurs when the user follows a broken link or if they type in a website address that doesn’t exist. A 404 page error appears when a website is active, but the specific page within it doesn’t exist. This guide illustrates the our styling for error pages - which may be used for 404 errors or extended to any other errors that an app needs to catch.\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Layout\\n\\nThe error page should include the app's `hc-navbar` but without any of the navbar-links active. The page background should be set to `$slate-gray-100` with the error message centered horizontally and positioned 25% from the top of the page. Styles for the error message have been included in the error-page.scss file. Below is example markup to create the error message displayed beneath this tile.\\n\\n```html\\n<div class=\\\"error-tile\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"content-column\\\"><div class=\\\"error-img\\\"></div></div>\\n    <div class=\\\"content-column\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"error-header-code\\\">404</div>\\n        <div class=\\\"error-message\\\">Sorry, we can't find the page you're looking for!</div>\\n    </div>\\n    <hr />\\n    <div class=\\\"error-button\\\">Go to Homepage</div>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"error-tile\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"content-column\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"error-img\\\"></div>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"content-column\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"error-header-code\\\">404</div>\\n        <div class=\\\"error-message\\\">\\n            Sorry, we can't find the page you're looking for!\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n    <hr>\\n    <div style=\\\"display: flex\\\"><div class=\\\"error-button\\\">Go to Homepage</div></div>\\n</div>\\n<br><br><br>\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Alternate Classes\\n\\nFor errors that need to display a string of text rather than an error code, the class `error-header-string` may be used instead. For longer error messages (a full sentence or more), the `error-message-light` class should be used. For access errors, an alternate image is available using the `access-error-img` class.\\n\\n```html\\n<div class=\\\"content-column\\\"><div class=\\\"access-error-img\\\"></div></div>\\n<div class=\\\"content-column\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"error-header-string\\\">Access Denied</div>\\n    <div class=\\\"error-message-light\\\">\\n        Looks like you are missing permissions to access this resource.

In these cases we recommend one of two approaches:\n        </p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>If importing the sass variables into your application, first try manipulating an existing color variable\n                using the built in sass functions\n                <code>darken()</code> or <code>lighten()</code>, or the library provided <code>shade()</code> or <code>tint()</code>\n                functions.\n\n                <pre><code>&#x00040;import &quot;../colors&quot;;\n\n.my-component &#123;\n    background-color: darken($slate-gray-100, 5%);\n    color: tint($dark-blue, 5%);\n&#125;</code></pre>\n\n            </li>\n            <li>If that doesn't suffice, or you are not using the sass variables, try using\n                <a href=\"https://coolors.co/6e53a3-d7dde4-00aeff-00a859-006d9a\" target=\"_blank\">coolors.co</a>\n                to help you stratify the base colors above or to generate new colors that fit within the color scheme. This\n                color tool will also help you determine when you should use dark or light text on top of your color.\n            </li>\n        </ol>\n    </hc-tile>\n\n    <hc-feedback-form></hc-feedback-form>\n</div>\n","import {Component, ElementRef, OnDestroy, ViewChild} from '@angular/core';\nimport {ActivatedRoute, Data, NavigationEnd, NavigationStart, Router} from '@angular/router';\nimport {takeUntil} from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport {Subject} from 'rxjs';\nimport {ApplicationInsightsService} from '../shared/application-insights/application-insights.service';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'hc-demo-content',\n    templateUrl: './content.component.html',\n    styleUrls: ['../shared/base-demo.component.scss']\n})\nexport class ContentComponent implements OnDestroy {\n    thisPage = '';\n    queryTab = 0;\n    selectOptions: Array<Data> = [];\n    categories: Array<string> = [];\n    private unsubscribe = new Subject<void>();\n    private appInsights;\n\n    @ViewChild('contentContainer') contentContainer: ElementRef;\n\n    constructor(private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute, private router: Router) {\n        this.appInsights = new ApplicationInsightsService();\n        // Listen for vertical tab bar navigation and update the select component\n        this.router.events.pipe(takeUntil(this.unsubscribe)).subscribe(event => {\n            if (event instanceof NavigationEnd) {\n                if (activatedRoute.firstChild) {\n                    this.thisPage = activatedRoute.firstChild.snapshot.data['title'];\n                    this.appInsights.logPageView(this.thisPage, event.urlAfterRedirects);\n                }\n            }\n            // Reset the scroll position of the vertical tab content container at the beginning of navigation\n            if (event instanceof NavigationStart && this.contentContainer) {\n                this.contentContainer.nativeElement.scrollTo(0, 0);\n            }\n        });\n\n        // Populate the responsive select component with the router information\n        let root = this.activatedRoute.routeConfig;\n        if ( root && root.children ) {\n            for (let entry of root.children ) {\n                if (entry.data && entry.data.title) {\n                    this.selectOptions.push(entry);\n                    if ( entry.data.category && !this.categories.includes( entry.data.category )) {\n                        this.categories.push( entry.data.category );\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        //  Gets the search parameter value from the url\n        this.activatedRoute.queryParams.subscribe(() => {\n            let currentPath = this.router.url;\n            currentPath = currentPath.replace( '/content/', '' );\n            const pathArray = currentPath.split( '?' );\n\n            if (this.selectOptions.length) {\n                for ( let i = 0; i < this.selectOptions.length; i++ ) {\n                    if (pathArray[0] === this.selectOptions[i].path) {\n                        this.queryTab = i;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Handle changes to the select component and navigate\n    selectUpdate(event: any) {\n        if (this.selectOptions.length) {\n            for (let entry of this.selectOptions) {\n                if (entry.data && event === entry.data.title) {\n                    this.router.navigate(['/content/' + entry.path]);\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Handle nav changes via the sidebar\n    navUpdate(page: any) {\n        this.router.navigate(['/content/' + page]);\n    }\n\n    ngOnDestroy(): void {\n        this.unsubscribe.next();\n        this.unsubscribe.complete();\n    }\n}\n","import {AfterContentInit, Component, ContentChildren, Input, Output, ViewEncapsulation} from '@angular/core';\nimport type {QueryList} from '@angular/core';\nimport {EventEmitter, TemplateRef} from '@angular/core';\nimport {TabComponent} from '../tab/tab.component';\nimport {ActivatedRoute, Router} from '@angular/router';\nimport {Subject} from 'rxjs';\nimport {takeUntil} from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport {parseBooleanAttribute} from '../../util';\n\nexport class TabChangeEvent {\n    constructor(public index: number, public tab: TabComponent) {}\n}\n\nexport function throwErrorForMissingRouterLink(tabsWithoutRouterLink: TabComponent[]) {\n    const tabTitles = tabsWithoutRouterLink.map(tab => tab.tabTitle);\n    throw Error(`Routerlink missing on ${tabTitles.join(',')}`);\n}\n\nconst supportedDirections = ['horizontal', 'vertical'];\n\nexport function validateDirectionInput(inputStr: string) {\n    if (supportedDirections.indexOf(inputStr) < 0) {\n        throw Error('Unsupported tab direction value: ' + inputStr);\n    }\n}\n\nexport function tabComponentMissing(): Error {\n    return new Error(`TabSet must contain at least one TabComponent.

updated February 24, 2021\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Overview\\n\\nTabs provide secondary navigation within the main sections on your navbar.\\nThe tabs in the Power BI template are based on the styling of the [Cashmere Tabs web component](/web/components/tabs/examples).\\nEach tab is a button that contains a bookmark link to another sheet.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Power BI Tabs](./assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-tabs.png \\\"Power BI Tabs\\\")\\n\\n</div><br>\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Formatting\\n\\nThe tab set buttons should be layered on top of a blank text object that extends the entire width of the tab content.\\n\\nFormatting of button text is as follows:\\n- **Font (selected tab)**: Segoe (Bold)\\n- **Font(unselected)**: Segoe UI\\n- **Font size**: 11pt\\n- **Font color**: offblack `#333333`\\n\\n### Floating Objects\\n\\nThe positioning of the floating line objects (Tab Selected, and Tab Set Underline) must be set manually.\\nThe Tab Set Underline width should extend from the left edge of the first tab to the right edge of the Spacer in the Tab Set container.\\n\\nIt's formatted as\\n- **Height**: 1px\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-300

Follow these guidelines to evaluate your sources:\\n1. Above all, consider credibility. Cite a government website, a well-known organization, or mainstream media outlet before any other source. Be sure the information is on the main page of a current website (outdated information might live in locations other than the main, current URL).\\n2. Avoid citing Wikipedia, a dictionary, or an encyclopedia. These may be good starting places for research, but they do nothing to add credibility because they are often secondary sources of information.\\n3. Do not cite other vendors.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### What Style to Use\\n\\nUse a modified [American Psychological Association (APA)](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples) style for most references.\\n\\n**HCAT Modifications to APA:**\\n - Delete the month/day after the author(s) and add “Retrieved from”    before the URL.\\n - If there are three or more authors, list only the first followed by \\\"et al.\\\" (e.g., “Asselah T. et al.”). If there are only two, list both (“Asselah, T. & Durantel, D.”).\\n - Replace any DOI with the source URL (a DOI or digital object identifier is a string of characters used by the APA to permanently identify an article or document and link to it on the web; not all sources will have a DOI).\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n\\n|          | Website Source | Article Source |\\n|----------|--------------------|---------------------|\\n|APA Standard Style| Ouellette, J.

Add the needed markup and css to your index.html file.\\nContrary to typical best practices, in this case it's preferrable to put the raw CSS/HTML for the launch screen directly into the index.html file. This allows the styles to be immediately available, avoiding a blank page while waiting for the needed HTTP requests to complete.\\n\\nIn Angular applications, this code can be placed within the root element tags (illustrated below), and will be replaced when the root component is ready.\\n\\n#### 2. Add your logo.\\nReplace the SVG XML inside the `#logoContainer` with your own app logo.

Wire in launch styles elsewhere as needed.\\nIf you'd like to show the launch screen after the initial load is complete, perhaps while you wait for authentication or other Angular resolvers to complete, you can also place the launch screen markup and styles in another component.

This will reduce the effort needed to read and understand code from multiple contributors to the library.\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### CSS Classes\\n\\nThe following general format should be followed when naming classes:\\n\\n`{company-scope}-{block-modifier}-{element}`\\n\\n-   {company scope} scopes all of our css to our company\\n-   {block modifier} is an element that can standalone within our company scope\\n-   {element} is element that can't standalone and requires the block modifier\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nExample class name: `.hc-form-field-label-wrapper`\\n\\n-   **company-scope**: hc\\n-   **block-modifier**: form-field (component name)\\n-   **element**: label-wrapper (css put on element within the component)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Angular Components\\n\\nComponents typically have a one word name following generally accepted descriptions of the item you are creating. If you're looking for examples of how similar elements are named, [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/develop/web/) system is a good baseline. If multiple words are needed in the name, they should be separated by a hyphen (\\\"-\\\") in their filename.\\n\\nClass names should be written as follows:\\n\\n`{component-name}-{component-type}`\\n\\n-   **component-name**: Same as the file name; upper camel case should be used for component definitions with multiple words (\\\"RadioButton\\\")\\n-   **component-type**: \\\"Component\\\", \\\"Directive\\\", etc\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nBelow is an example of component naming following the above rules:\\n\\n-   Filename: `app-switcher.component.ts`\\n-   Class name: `AppSwitcherComponent`\\n\\n:::\\n\";","export default \"# Data Engineer\\n\\n###### Last updated Nov 30, 2020\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<div class=\\\"persona-header\\\">\\n\\n![Avatar Image](./assets/avatars/avatar61.svg)\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n# Erica Garcia\\n\\n### Data Engineer\\n\\nJunior data architect at a healthcare organization.

To get started, follow the [Getting Started guide](http://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/web/guides/getting-started).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Setup Environment\\n\\n1.  Install the latest version of `node` with at _least_ version 8.9.\\n2.  Fork the `@healthcatalyst/cashmere` repo.\\n3.  Clone your fork. Recommendation: name your git remotes `upstream` for `@healthcatalyst/cashmere`\\n4.  From the root of the project, run `npm install`\\n5.  Running `npm run build` will build the entire project.\\n6.  `npm start` will serve the default project which is `user-guide` (the documentation site)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Contributing to Cashmere\\n\\n### While Developing\\n\\n1.  You may need to run `npm run build` before you start, especially if it's your first time running Cashmere.\\n2.  Run `npm start`. This will fire up the user guide website, and rebuild/reload when changes are made to the user guide site or the Cashmere library.\\n3.  To run locally in BrowserStack, run `npm run start-bs` and start up your local testing in BrowserStack. Enter bs-local.com:4200 as your url.\\n\\n### Code Documentation\\n\\nThe API documentation for Cashmere is auto-generated directly from the TypeScript source using [Dgeni](https://github.com/angular/dgeni) (based on [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/)). Be sure that all public components and modules are exported in the `index.ts` file of that component's directory. That will ensure that the documentation generator parses all included code. The following are best-practices to ensure the docs are generated correctly:\\n\\n#### Comment Formatting\\n\\nComments should be begin with `/**` followed by a space and end with a space, then `*/`. If a comment spans multiple lines, each new line should begin with a space, `*`, and another space.\\n\\n```\\n/** The navbar is a wrapper that positions branding, navigation, and\\n * other elements in a concise header. */\\n@Component({\\n    ...\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### What Comments to Include\\n\\n-   Add a comment above any `@Component` definitions that describe the function of the component\\n-   Add a comment above `@Input` definitions describing the purpose and usage of the input as well as their default value\\n-   Add a comment above any public functions describing the function and any parameters\\n\\n```\\n/** Fixes the position of navbar to the top of the page. *Default is false.* */\\n@Input()\\nfixedTop: boolean = false;\\n```\\n\\n#### Excluding Items from Docs\\n\\nAny component variables or functions that are meant only to be used internally and should not be included in the documentation should begin with an underscore in their name.\\n\\n```\\n_menuOpen: boolean = false;\\n```\\n\\n### Usage Documentation\\n\\nIn addition to the auto-generated API docs, a component may include an optional \\\"Usage\\\" section that describes additional information on configuring or working with the component. The usage page is written in markdown format and is included in the same directory as the component source. It should have the same name as the source file (e.g. `select.md` if the source is named `select.component.ts`). In the `DocItem` array in `document-items.service.ts`, the component should have its `usageDoc` flag set to `true`.\\n\\n### Pull Requests\\n\\nBefore you submit your pull request (PR), consider the following guidelines:\\n\\n-   Search [GitHub](https://github.com/HealthCatalyst/Fabric.Cashmere/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\\n-   Development happens on the `dev` branch and `master` is used to create a new release.\\n-   From the dev branch create a new branch. Here is a good [guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) if you're just getting started.\\n-   Verify all changes look and function properly in different browsers and at different resolutions.\\n-   Run the following commands:\\n    -   `npm run lint` should result in `All files pass linting`\\n    -   If there are problems with prettier linting rules, running `npm run prettier` can be helpful. This will automatically make needed formatting changes based on our prettier rules. For Windows users, runs best in bash.\\n    -   `npm run test:unit` should result in `All tests passing`\\n    -   `npm run build` should pass and build the library successfully.\\n-   New components and directives must be accompanied by:\\n    -   A component demonstrating the functionality; this component should be added to the demo app's routes.\\n    -   Unit tests demonstrating that it functions as intended.\\n-   A new component should adhere to the [Health Catalyst style](http://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net).\\n-   When creating a PR you must set the base branch to dev(master is for release only)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Commit Message Guidelines\\n\\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more\\nreadable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,\\nwe use the git commit messages to **generate the Cashmere change log** and **determine the next semver\\nversion** of the package.\\n\\n(To help with creating commit messages you should use `commitizen` by running `npm run cm` when you want to commit)\\n\\n### Commit Message Format\\n\\nEach commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special\\nformat that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:\\n\\n```\\n<type>(<scope>): <subject>\\n<BLANK LINE>\\n<body>\\n<BLANK LINE>\\n<footer>\\n```\\n\\nThe **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.\\n\\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! This makes the message easier\\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\\n\\n### Revert\\n\\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of\\nthe reverted commit.

The styles presented here don't seek to rewrite any of those books, but instead are primarily aimed at maximizing readability and consistency in our charts. But if you are looking for an excellent, no-nonsense guide for improving your visualizations, we highly recommend Scott Berinato's [Good Charts](http://a.co/9uDIcKr).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Layout\\n\\n![Chart Example](./assets/analytics/tableau/chartoverview.png \\\"Chart Example\\\")\\n\\nCharts follow all the general standards for tiles as defined in the [Foundations section](/analytics/tableau-foundations).\\nRefer to that **Tile Header** and **Divider** sections of that page for specific parameters to apply to the top of the chart tile.\\n\\nIf a subheader or additional controls are needed for a chart, they should be the next item under the header divider.\\nThe content of the chart appears in the area below.\\nThe Outer Padding for the chart should be at least `10px` on the right and left so it aligns with the edges of the header.\\nThe exact size of a tile for a chart will be determined by the other content that has to fit on the page and what is required for readability of the data.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Grid Styles\\n\\nAxis lines within charts should be formatted as:\\n- **Weight**: 1px\\n- **Color**: offblack `#333333`\\n\\nAxis text/labels should be formatted as:\\n- **Font**: Tableau Book\\n- **Font size**: 9pt\\n- **Color**: offblack `#333333`\\n\\nGrid lines should be set to:\\n- **Weight**: 1px\\n- **Style**: Dotted\\n- **Color**: gray-300 `cccccc`\\n\\n![Grid Lines](./assets/analytics/tableau/gridlines.png \\\"Grid Lines\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Data Colors\\n\\nTo determine what colors should be used together in charts, you should determine what the data is trying to convey. If it’s a normal reporting chart for general use, blues and cool colors should be used to keep consistency. Refer to the colors in [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations/color) for options that fit within our Health Catalyst palette. Grays should be used for either showing a benchmark or previous years to contrast the difference of the current year.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Hover States\\n\\nThe specific content of tooltips of the chart will be dictated by the data being displayed.\\nBut in general, they should contain a label and a value.\\n\\nAll text in the tooltip should be set to:\\n\\n- **Font**: 10pt\\n- **Color**: offblack `#333333`\\n- **Label font**: Tableau Book\\n- **Value font**: Tableau Bold\\n\\n![Chart Tooltips](./assets/analytics/tableau/charttooltip.png \\\"Chart Tooltips\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Info Tooltip\\n\\nEvery chart should include an info tooltip in its header.\\nRefer to the [Foundations section](/analytics/tableau-foundations) for information on how to configure it.\\nThe info tooltip should provide a longer description of what is being visualized on the chart, how it should read, and any considerations when evaluating it.\\nIf additional controls are included above the chart, the info tooltip can also provide instructions on how to interact with the chart.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Drill-down\\n\\nAs with KPI metrics, a drill-down button should generally be included with every chart.\\nThe purpose of the drill-down button is to allow the user to look into the raw data being displayed on the chart.\\nIt serves as an opportunity for validation and additional exploration.\\nMost accelerators will want to include a \\\"Measure Explorer\\\" page similar to that of our decision support application, [Leading Wisely](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/product/leading-wisely/).\\nThe Measure Explorer tab is what the chart drill-down will typically link to with the particular metric selected.\\nRefer to the template for an example implementation of a Measure Explorer page.\\n:::\\n\";","<div class=\"demo-content\">\n    <h1>Health Catalyst Brand Colors</h1>\n    <h6>Last updated January 21, 2021</h6>\n\n    <hc-tile>\n        <h5 id=\"overview\">Overview</h5>\n\n        <p>The colors included on this page represent our brand.\n        For colors to be used in software applications, please refer to <a routerLink=\"/foundations/color\" routerLinkActive=\"active\">UI Colors</a>.\n        That color set shares the same foundations but is specifically tailored towards values that improve\n        usability for buttons, links and other user interface elements.</p>\n    </hc-tile>\n\n    <hc-tile>\n        <h5 id=\"brand-palette\">Primary Colors</h5>\n        <p>These are the foundational colors of the brand.

They're built from three parts:\\n\\n1.  A set of SCSS mixins defining the styles for the component, its sub-components, and different states the component can be in (like \\\"invalid\\\" or \\\"loading\\\").\\n1.  A set of CSS classes that import the mixins and implement them in a default way. Cashmere components don't use view encapsulation, so these CSS classes are global.\\n1.  An Angular component, which includes HTML markup and basic functionality.\\n\\nThe Angular component is not meant to fit every possible use case. Instead, it focuses on the most common, expected use cases. For example, Cashmere's button component includes various colors of buttons, link buttons, icon buttons, and split buttons, but if you want a floating action button or a button that changes its contents on hover, you'll have to build it yourself. The way components are built makes it easy to do that. You can opt in to the level of flexibility or convenience you need. From most flexible to most convenient:\\n\\n-   You can import the SCSS mixins and use them in a custom stylesheet for your own component, overriding rules as needed.\\n-   You can import the component and use its CSS classes in the markup for your own component.\\n-   You can import the component and use it as-is.\\n\\nAll components in this documentation use the last method. For examples of the other two, see the repository [cashmere-integration-examples](https://github.com/isaaclyman/cashmere-integration-examples). It includes a vanilla HTML site that uses Cashmere via CSS classes, and a Vue app that uses Cashmere via SCSS mixins.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Style guidelines for new components\\n\\nAll Cashmere components should meet the following expectations:\\n\\n-   The component stylesheet (e.g. `button.component.scss`) should not include any CSS rules. It should only have @import statements, CSS selectors, and @include statements. This ensures that all the component's styles can be used via mixins--none of them are bound to the component.\\n-   CSS selectors in the component stylesheet should be prefixed with `hc-{component name}-`. Remember that component CSS is not view-encapsulated, so good prefixing helps us avoid style collisions.\\n-   The mixin stylesheet (e.g. `sass/button.scss`) should not include any top-level CSS selectors. Each top-level item should be a mixin.\\n-   The mixin stylesheet should not include any nested CSS selectors that would make confusing assumptions about the user's HTML structure. That is, the `[disabled]` attribute selector and pseudo-selectors like `:hover` or `:after` are okay, but class or tag names like `.hc-checked` and `input` should be avoided.\\n-   Both stylesheets should be as flat as possible. Nesting CSS selectors in SCSS files creates extremely specific selectors which are hard to override. Cashmere should make it easy to override a style rule if needed. CSS classes can be added to component markup to avoid nesting.\\n-   If nesting more than 2 levels deep is unavoidable, an overridable SCSS variable (with `!default`) can be added to the mixins file to allow the user to set the rule before importing the mixins.\\n\\n:::\\n\";","import {Component, OnDestroy, OnInit} from '@angular/core';\nimport {ActivatedRoute, Router} from

server, database, metadata, last updates, etc\\n- **Owners & Contacts** - email links to the application owners and data stewards in case a user has concerns about the data\\n- **Description** - an explanation of why this accelerator was created and how it works\\n- **What to use the app for** - a list of the suggested use cases for this accelerator\\n- **What NOT to use the app for** - a list of the limitations of the accelerator, and the use cases it should not be used for\\n- **Release Notes** - for each update to an accelerator, include a list of what enhancements have been made and what bugs have been fixed\\n- **Tab Descriptions** - a brief description of what can be found on each link in the navbar\\n- **Definitions** - a glossary of terms or calculations used within the application\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Sidebar\\n\\nThe Sidebar vertical text box is used on the About page for app details and should be formatted as follows:\\n\\n- **Type**: Text object\\n- **Width**: 250px\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-100 `#f0f3f6`\\n- **Padding**: 12px on left and right sides\\n\\n\\nThe first two items in the sidebar should be the name of the accelerator and the current version number.\\nYou should be able to simply edit the text in the template.\\n\\nThe remaining items in the sidebar are unique to your application. Card visuals are used to display items that rely upon data fields (such as a last refresh date).\\nExamples are included in the template, but they may be edited or removed as needed.\\n\\nInfo item formatting:\\n- **Font (label)**: Segoe (Bold)\\n- **Font size (label)**: 11pt\\n\\n- **Font (value)**: Segoe UI\\n- **Font size (value)**: 10pt\\n\\nEach info item in the sidebar is separated by `25px` of blank space.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Content Area\\n\\nThe Content Area has a **white** `#ffffff` background for the About Page.\\n\\nThe first item in the Content Area is the full Health Catalyst horizontal logo:\\n- **Type**: Image\\n- **Position**: `x:514, y:87`\\n- **Width**: 463px\\n- **Height**: 146px\\n- **Scaling**: Normal\\n- **Aspect lock**: On\\n\\nThe second item in the content area is a banner with the name of the accelerator, positioned with the following values\\n- **Position**: `x:450, y:145`\\n- **Width**: 600px\\n- **Height**: 30px\\n\\n### Tabs\\n\\nThe next item in the content area is a horizontal slicer object.\\nThe styling and setup of the tabs follow the guidelines for described in the [Tabs section](/analytics/powerbi-tabs).\\nThe first tab should almost always be \\\"About this App\\\", where an overview of the app and usage guidelines are provided.\\n\\nFor the remaining tabs, you may choose what is most appropriate for your application.\\n\\nThe text within each tab should be set to:\\n- **Font**: Segoe UI\\n- **Font color**: offblack `#333333`\\n- **Font size**: 10pt\\n\\nHeaders within the text should be set to\\n- **Font**: Segoe (Bold)\\n- **Font color**: dark-blue `#006d9a`\\n- **Font size**: 12pt\\n\\n### Pagination\\n\\nIf there is more text than fits onto a single page within a tab, you may incorporate pagination into your tab.\\nRefer to the \\\"Definitions\\\" tab in the template for an example of a pagination controller.\\nThe pagination controller is comprised of Page Buttons horizontally aligned with each other. The text within the buttons should be vertically and horizontally aligned.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Pagination Controller](./assets/analytics/tableau/pagination.png \\\"Pagination Controller\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nEach button should have a border with the following values:\\n- **Weight**: 1px\\n- **Style**: Solid\\n- **Color**: slate-gray-300 `#c0c5cc`\\n\\nThe text in each button should be `PAGE X` with page in uppercase letters.\\n\\nButton font should be set to:\\n- **Font**: Segoe (Bold)\\n- **Size**: 11pt\\nThe selected page's button is formatted as:\\n\\n- **Background**: blue `#00aeff`\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n\\nDe-selected page buttons are formatted as:\\n- **Background**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Font color**: dark-blue

However, Qlik does not easily support embedding custom fonts, and we don't want to rely on users having these fonts installed. The following guidelines translate the Cashmere standard into a Qlik-friendly format:\\n\\n### App Name\\n\\nUse of the Flexo font in the Health Catalyst brand is generally limited to logos and app names. In the Qlik template, we only feature it in the app name on the navbar. The font is baked into an image so there is no type dependency. Information on obtaining a logo image for your app can be found on in the [navbar section](/analytics/qlik-navbar).\\n\\n### Primary Font\\n\\nHealth Catalyst's primary font is Open Sans - a clean, readable, sans-serif typeface.\\nAlthough Qlik doesn't easily allow us to use Open Sans, it does come packaged with a very similar typeface called *Arial* which includes several weight variations. Because Power BI doesn't consistently provide access to formatting options such as bolding,\\nin Health Catalyst Power BI applications, we leverage **Arial**, **Arial Bold**, and **Segoe UI Light**.\\nInformation about specific font sizes and weights can be found throughout this style guide, and examples of correct usage can be found in the template.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">\\n\\n![Arial](/assets/analytics/qlik/arial_1.png \\\"Arial Typeface\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Icons\\nIcons should come from Health Catalyst's [icon set](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/styles/icons) and should be sized similarly to adjacent text.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Color\\n\\nQlik doesn't always render color values exactly the same as a web browser would.\\nBut for consistency we still use all the same colors from the [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations/color) for colors in Qlik.\\nSpecific color usage information can be found throughout the style guide, within the template's object visuals, and in the underlying load script code packaged with the template.\\nFor information related to the use of color in data visualizations, refer to the [charts section](/analytics/qlik-charts).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Customer Branding\\n\\nHealth Catalyst regards our analytic accelerators as products every bit as much as our web applications.\\nAs with our web applications, we allow our products to be co-branded, but not white-labeled.\\nCustomers may incorporate their logo into the navbar ([same as our web applications](/web/components/navbar/examples?section=navbar-cobrand)),\\nbut any Health Catalyst brand elements (colors, fonts, logos, etc) should not be removed or altered.\\n\\nRefer to the [navbar section](/analytics/qlik-navbar) section for more information about adding a customer's logo to your Qlik app's navbar.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Layout\\n\\nThe standard page size for a Health Catalyst Qlik application is **1280x900px**.\\n\\nWithin that space, the layout is divided into three primary areas: Navbar, Sidebar, and Content Area.\\nNote that if content needs to be further subdivided within the content area, [Tabs](/analytics/qlik-tabs) may be included in that space.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Layout Elements](./assets/analytics/tableau/layoutelements.png \\\"Layout Elements\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Navbar\\n\\nThe navbar is a horizontal container with a fixed `50px` height.\\nDetailed information on the navbar and how to configure it is included in the [navbar section](/analytics/qlik-navbar).\\n\\n### Sidebar\\n\\nThe sidebar is a vertical container with a fixed `250px` width.\\nIt typically contains filters, but can also be used as an information panel.\\nDetails about use of the sidebar can be found in the [filters section](/analytics/qlik-filters) and [about section](/analytics/qlik-about).\\n\\n### Content Area\\n\\nThe background color for the content area can be one of the following values:\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-100 `#f0f3f6 RGB(240,243,246)`\\n- **Background**: white `#ffffff RGB(255,255,255)`\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Tiles\\n\\nVisualization objects such as charts, graphs, tables, and KPIs should be styled like the Cashmere [tile component](/web/components/tile) and will be referred to as tiles within this section.\\n\\nIn general, a Qlik tile should be formatted accordingly:\\n- **Background**: white `#ffffff RGB(255,255,255)`\\n- **Border**: white `#ffffff RGB(255,255,255)`\\n- **Radius**: 5px\\n\\nEach tile should also have shadow with the following values:\\n\\n- **Color**: black `#000000 RGB(0,0,0)`\\n- **Intensity**: soft\\n- **Transparency**: 85%\\n\\nTiles should have at least 10px of padding between each other (5px on either side).\\n\\nLayout specifics for the most common visual objects can be found in the [KPI Metrics section](/analytics/qlik-metrics), [Charts section](/analytics/qlik-charts), and [Tables section](/analytics/qlik-tables).

Filters\\n\\n###### Last updated February 24, 2021\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Overview\\n\\nFilters are a foundational element of any analytics accelerator.\\nThey allow users to more deeply investigate the cause of trends or finds areas for improvement.\\nBut filters can be a double-edged sword, because they can also add significant complexity to both the UI and UX of an accelerator.\\nAs a result, care must be taken in what filters are given prominence and how they are displayed.\\n\\nAnother important consideration with filters is ensuring that user has a clear understanding of what filters are currently active.\\nThe sidebar is always visible, so filters being used can be easily seen.\\n*Be careful about applying any filters that are not easily reset or not visible to the user.*\\n\\n![Filter Sidebar](./assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-filter-pane.png \\\"Filter Sidebar\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Sidebar\\n\\nFor consistency, filters should be displayed on the sidebar of the accelerator layout.\\n\\nFormat a filter sidebar accordingly:\\n- **Type**: Text object\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-400 `#708090 RGB(112,128,144)`\\n- **Width**: 250px\\n\\nThere should be 10px of vertical space at the top of the sidebar before the first filter or metric.\\n\\n### Counts\\n\\nFrequently it is useful for accelerators to a display a count of key metrics as part of the filter sidebar (e.g. Encounters, Unique Patients).\\nThis gives users a clear indication of the sample size being used to determine the values on their dashboard.\\nFor example, if they've filtered the sample size down too small, the values in the dashboard will no longer be useful.\\nAs many counts may be included as needed, one on top of the other.\\n\\n![Filter Counts](./assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-filter-counts.png \\\"Filter Counts\\\")\\n\\nThese counts should be the first item on the sidebar, and are formatted with the following values:\\n\\nCounts labels:\\n- **Alignment**: left-justified\\n- **Font**: Arial\\n- **Font Size**: 10pt\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff RGB(255,255,255)`\\n- **Text margin**: 6pt\\n\\nCounts values:\\n- **Alignment**: right-justified\\n- **Font**: Arial(Bold)\\n- **Font size**: 17pt\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff RGB(255,255,255)`\\n- **Text margin**: 6pt\\n\\n### Controls\\n\\nControls (or filters), are usually grouped together and should be formatted with the following values:\\n\\n![Filter Control](./assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-filter-control.png \\\"Filter Control\\\")\\n\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff RGB(255,255,255)`\\n- **Font (label)**: Arial, 11pt\\n- **Font (sub-control)**: Arial, 10pt\\n\\n### Footer\\n\\nAs with counts, most accelerators benefit from including a footer indicating the last refresh of the data.\\nThis gives users confidence that the values in the dashboard are current and valid.\\n\\nIn general, the footer should be set to:\\n\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff RGB(255,255,255)`\\n- **Font (label)**: Arial, 9pt\\n- **Font (sub-control)**: Arial, 11pt\\n- **Padding**: 4px\\n- **Height**: 55px\\n\\n![Filter Footer](./assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-filter-footer.png \\\"Filter Footer\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n##### Advanced Filters\\n\\n![Advanced Filters](./assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-advanced-filters.png \\\"Advanced Filters\\\")\\n\\nThe sidebar filters should be the primary mechanic for filtering that most users leverage.\\nHowever, there may be power users of your accelerator who require the ability to define more precise or detailed cohorts.\\nFor those users, you may want to include an \\\"Advanced Filters\\\" page that includes a wider array of filter options.\\n\\nFrom a UX perspective, the risk with a page like this is that a user will define filters and then forget they turned them on.\\nThat's why we want to limit this page primarily to power users.\\nYou can link to it via an icon in the navbar (use the *AdvancedFilters.png* image included with the other [icons](https://dev.azure.com/healthcatalyst/Analytic%20Solutions/_git/ASO?path=%2F_references%2F_includes%2Fimages%2FHealthCatalystStockSet%2Fhcicons%2FPNG) within the code repository), which keeps

the mark or with the most prominent use of the mark is sufficient. The logo, if it appears, does not count as the first use.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nDo not use trademarked terms as nouns—only use as an adjective. For example:\\n\\n-   **Yes:** The HAS® conference… or The CORUS™ Suite\\n-   **No:** HAS® is an awesome conference. CORUS™ is more than some outdated cost system.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nFurther, use the mark as a proper adjective modifying a noun that identifies the kind of product offered. Use the trademark together with the generic name of the product/service.\\n\\n-   **Yes:** Health systems that value a next-generation costing system rely on the CORUS™ software.\\n-   **No:** Health systems that value a next-generation costing system rely on CORUS™.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nNever alter a trademark. Do not make it possessive. Do not add prefixes, hyphens, or otherwise modify.\\n\\n-   **Yes:** The reliability of Health Catalyst® services means that health systems can count on…\\n-   **No:** Health Catalyst’s service and reliability means that health systems can count on…\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nFor the registered marks, use the ® (R in the circle) superscript symbol on the mark, which indicates that it is federally registered.\\n\\nFor the unregistered marks, use the TM superscript symbol, which helps to establish rights in the marks and can be used whether or not they are registered (no approval needed).\\n\\nUse the superscript symbols on logos, whenever they appear.\\n\\n:::\\n\";","export default \"# Using Cashmere Bits\\n\\n###### Last updated October 12, 2020\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### What is a Cashmere Bit?\\n\\nThe Cashmere project aims to deliver lightweight and bulletproof components for your applications.\\nAs part of that commitment, components that require additional third-party dependencies are not\\nincluded in the main Cashmere NPM package.

About Page\\n\\n###### Last updated February 24, 2021\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Overview\\n\\nThe About Page is the primary source of supporting information for users about the application.\\nIt is a standard element of every analytics accelerator, and should always be accessed by clicking the question-mark icon in the top right of the navbar.\\nWe do **not** include open analytics accelerators with splash pages any longer.\\nIt's a better user experience to open directly to the Summary page of the accelerator, and include all app information on this about page.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![About Page](./assets/analytics/tableau/aboutoverview.png \\\"About Page\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nAlthough the template has values hard-coded into the About Page, it's a best practice to pull as much of the content from an external source like an IDEA database.\\nThat way the app doesn't have to be republished for this information to change.\\n\\nIn general, the about page should include the following (but you may adjust based on the specific needs of your accelerator):\\n\\n- **Technical Details** - server, database, metadata, last updates, etc\\n- **Owners & Contacts** - email links to the application owners and data stewards in case a user has concerns about the data\\n- **Description** - an explanation of why this accelerator was created and how it works\\n- **What to use the app for** - a list of the suggested use cases for this accelerator\\n- **What NOT to use the app for** - a list of the limitations of the accelerator, and the use cases it should not be used for\\n- **Release Notes** - for each update to an accelerator, include a list of what enhancements have been made and what bugs have been fixed\\n- **Tab Descriptions** - a brief description of what can be found on each link in the navbar\\n- **Definitions** - a glossary of terms or calculations used within the application\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Sidebar\\n\\nWithin the Body horizontal container, the Sidebar vertical container is used on the About page for app details.\\n\\nThe Sidebar should be formatted with the following values:\\n- **Width**: 250px\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-100 `#f0f3f6`\\n- **Padding (inner)**: 12px on the left and right of the Sidebar container\\n\\nThe first two items in the sidebar should be the name of the accelerator and the current version number.\\nYou should be able to simply edit the text in the template.\\n\\nThe remaining items in the sidebar are unique to your application.\\nExamples are included in the template, but they may be edited or removed as needed.\\n\\n- **Font (label)**: Tableau Bold, 11pt\\n- **Font (content)**: Tableau Regular, 10pt\\n\\nEach info item in the Sidebar is separated by a 25px blank spacer.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Content Area\\n\\nThe Content Area in the Body horizonal container has a **white** `#ffffff` background for the About Page.\\nThe first item in the Content Area vertical container is the full Health Catalyst horizontal logo, with top inner padding set to 30px.\\n\\nThe second item in the content area is a banner with the name of the accelerator.\\nYou'll need to right-click on the AppName.svg image and Edit Image.\\nSwap the image file to the same image svg that you are using for the navbar.\\nAll other sizing and padding for the banner should adjust automatically.\\n\\n### Tabs\\n\\nThe next item in the content area is Tab Set horizontal container.\\nThe styling and setup of the tabs follow the guidelines for described in the [Tabs section](/analytics/tableau-tabs).\\nThe first tab should almost always be \\\"About this App\\\", where an overview of the app and usage guidelines are provided.\\n\\nFor the remaining tabs, you may choose what is most appropriate for your application.\\n\\nThe text within each tab should be set as follows:\\n\\n- **Font**: Tableau Book, 10pt\\n- **Color**: offblack `#333333`\\n\\nHeaders within the text should be set as follows:\\n- **Font**: Tableau Bold, 12pt\\n- **Color**: dark-blue `#006d9a`\\n\\n### Pagination\\n\\nIf there is more text than fits onto a single page within a tab, you may incorporate pagination into your tab.\\nRefer to the \\\"Definitions\\\" tab in the template for an example of a pagination controller.\\nThe pagination horizontal container includes Page Buttons centered with a blank spacer on either side.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Pagination Controller](./assets/analytics/tableau/pagination.png \\\"Pagination Controller\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nEach button should be formatted as:\\n\\n- **Border**: 1px\\n- **Border color**: slate-gray-300 `#c0c5cc`\\n- **Font**: Tableau Bold, 11pt\\n\\nSelected buttons are formatted as:\\n- **Background**: blue `#00aeff`\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n\\nUn-selected buttons are formatted as:\\n- **Background**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Font color**: Tableau doesn't let us select a custom color, so we have to use the closest blue to our palette. Select the blue swatch in the first row, seventh column of the color picker.\\n\\n\\nThe text in each button should be `PAGE X` with page in uppercase letters.\\n\\n:::\\n\";","import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {CommonModule} from '@angular/common';\nimport {MarkdownDirective} from './markdown/markdown.directive';\nimport {MarkdownContentComponent} from '../shared/markdown-content.component';\nimport {SwatchDemoComponent} from './swatch/swatch-demo.component';\nimport {HighlightDirective} from './highlight/highlight.directive';\nimport {CashmereModule} from './cashmere.module';\nimport {FeedbackFormComponent} from '../shared/feedback-form/feedback-form.component';\nimport {FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule} from '@angular/forms';\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [CommonModule, CashmereModule, ReactiveFormsModule],\n    declarations: [MarkdownDirective, HighlightDirective, MarkdownContentComponent, SwatchDemoComponent, FeedbackFormComponent],\n    exports: [\n        MarkdownDirective,\n        HighlightDirective,\n        SwatchDemoComponent,\n        FeedbackFormComponent,\n        CommonModule,\n        CashmereModule,\n        FormsModule,\n        ReactiveFormsModule\n    ]\n})\nexport class SharedModule {}\n","export default \"# System Administrator\\n\\n###### Last updated Nov 30, 2020\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<div class=\\\"persona-header\\\">\\n\\n![Avatar Image](./assets/avatars/avatar37.svg)\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n# Denis Jackson\\n\\n### System Administrator / Database Admin\\n\\nSystem Administrator is responsible for installing new software releases, system upgrades, evaluates and installs patches and resolves software related problems.

Overview\\n\\n![Navbar Example](./assets/analytics/tableau/navbarexample.png \\\"Navbar Example\\\")\\n\\nThe navbar is one of the most distinguishing elements of a Cashmere application.\\nIt is a hallmark of the Health Catalyst app brand on all platforms.\\nFor this reason, the styling of the navbar should not be altered from the template.\\n\\nThe Navbar is a Horizontal Container with a fixed 50px height.\\nBelow is the hierarchy for the container (a floating item called \\\"Selected Highlight\\\" is also part of the navbar):\\n\\n![Navbar Hierarchy](./assets/analytics/tableau/navbarhierarchy.png \\\"Navbar Hierarchy\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Brand\\n\\nBrand is a fixed width horizontal container.\\n- **Background**: blue `#00aeff`\\n- **Height**: 50px\\n- **Width**: 50px\\n\\nWithin the container is an SVG of the Health Catalyst tri-flame.\\n- **Padding (outer)**: 8px\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### App Name\\n\\nApp Name is the second fixed width horizontal container in the navbar, also containing one SVG image.\\nThe image is the name of your application in the Flexo font (so the font isn't needed).\\nTo obtain an SVG for your application, contact the UX team via the `#design` Slack channel.\\n\\nEdit the `AppName.svg` Image Object and swap the image file with the one for your application.\\n`Fit Image` should be checked, but `Center Image` should not.\\nDon't alter the Outer Padding settings on the image (set to `20, 12, 0 12`).\\n\\n![App Name](./assets/analytics/tableau/appname.png \\\"App Name Resizing\\\")\\n\\n**Important:** you will need to change the width of the App Name container to suit the width of your app name.\\nYou want the width to be just wide enough to contain the image without shrinking it.\\nRight-click on the App Name container and Edit Width.\\nBegin by making the container very wide (e.g. 300).\\nThen continue to edit the width and reduce the size of the container until it's almost touching the right side of the image, but the image is not being scaled.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Links\\n\\nLinks is a flexible width horizontal container with all the navigation links to the different sections of your application.\\nThe first item in the container is a 25px width spacer to provide padding between the app name and the first link.\\nDepending on the number of sections in your application, drag additional Navigation Objects (text buttons) into the container.\\n\\nThe Outer Padding on any navbar link should be set to `4, 5, 4, 3`.\\nThese values are important so the bottom of the navbar text aligns with the bottom of the app name.\\nThe background color and border on the button should be set to `None`.\\n\\nThe button for the currently selected page should be formatted as:\\n\\n- **Font (selected)**: Tableau Bold\\n- **Color**: white (the second swatch in the top row of the Font color picker)\\n\\nAdditionally, there is a floating item at the top of the root hierarchy called `Selected Highlight` that should be positioned under the selected item.\\nThe y position of that item should always be set to 46, but the x position should match the x position of the selected button item.\\nThe width of the selected highlight item should also match the selected button item.\\nAdjust the left & right Outer Padding of Selected Highlight to account for padding and center the blue underline under the bold text.\\n\\n![Selected Link](./assets/analytics/tableau/selected.png \\\"Selected link\\\")\\n\\nAll other buttons should be formatted as:\\n\\n- **Font**: Tableau Regular\\n- **Color**: gray-200 (the second swatch in the fourth row of the Font color picker)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Menu Icons\\n\\nMenu Icons is fixed width horizontal container that typically only contains the question-mark icon linking to the [About Page](/analytics/tableau-about).\\nA spacer on the right side is also included to add padding before the co-branding space.\\n\\nThe question-mark icon is an Image Button with its Inner Padding set to 14 on all sides.\\nAdditional menu icon links may be added to the left of the question-mark icon - for example, links to a search page, app switcher, etc.\\nOne commonly used icon is for an Advanced Filters page (see the [Filters Section](/analytics/tableau-filters) for more information).\\nGuidelines for icon selection can be found in [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations/icons).\\nThey should have the same styling with a width and height set to 50px.\\nAdd 50px to the fixed width of the Menu Icons container for any icons added.\\nContact the UX team via the `#design` Slack channel for icon svgs.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Co-branding\\n\\nCo-Branding is the final fixed width horizontal container set to:\\n- **Width**: 200px\\n- **Background**: white `#ffffff`\\n\\nThis space allows applications to include the logo of your customer.\\nIdeally you'll want the horizontal version of a customer's logo with a white or transparent background.\\nTo configure this section, you should only have to Edit the Image and swap the file.\\nIt should automatically resize to fit best within the container.\\n\\nNote that this is an optional section.\\nIf your application does not require co-branding, right-click on the Co-Branding container and \\\"Remove from Dashboard\\\".\\n\\n:::\\n\";","import {Component, ViewEncapsulation, TemplateRef, ViewChild} from '@angular/core';\n\n/** Contains the HTML markup for tab titles */\n@Component({\n    selector:

2021\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### About the template\\n\\nThe Health Catalyst Tableau template adheres to the overall [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations) as much as possible, while preserving any established usage patterns unique to Tableau.\\nWhenever beginning a new app, be sure to download the [most current version](/analytics/tableau-template) of the template that your environment supports.\\n\\n![Tableau Template](./assets/analytics/tableau/templatescreenshot.png \\\"Tableau Template\\\")\\n\\nUpdates to the template are version controlled, and notes are provided to explain what changed between updates.\\nVersions follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) system which utilizes three numbers (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) indicating the following:\\n\\n- **MAJOR** version is a significant change with new compatibility requirements, such as dropping support for an older version of Tableau\\n- **MINOR** version adds functionality in a backward compatible manner\\n- **PATCH** version includes bug fixes or style tweaks that are backwards compatible\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Type\\n\\nThe Health Catalyst brand includes [two fonts](/foundations/typography): **Flexo** and **Open Sans**. However, Tableau does not easily support embedding custom fonts, and we don't want to rely on users having these fonts installed. The following guidelines translate the Cashmere standard into a Tableau-friendly format:\\n\\n### App Name\\n\\nUse of the Flexo font in the Health Catalyst brand is generally limited to logos and app names. In the Tableau template, we only feature it in the app name on the navbar. The font is baked into an image so there is no type dependency. Information on obtaining a logo image for your app can be found on in the [navbar section](/analytics/tableau-navbar).\\n\\n### Primary Font\\n\\nHealth Catalyst's primary font is Open Sans - a clean, readable, sans-serif typeface.\\nAlthough Tableau doesn't allow us to use Open Sans, it does come packaged with a very similar typeface called *Tableau* which includes several weights.\\nSo in Health Catalyst Tableau applications, we leverage **Tableau Regular**, **Tableau Bold**, and **Tableau Book**.\\nInformation about specific font sizes and weights can be found throughout this style guide, and examples of correct usage can be found in the template.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">\\n\\n![Tableau Book Typeface](./assets/analytics/tableau/tableaubook.png \\\"Tableau Book Typeface\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Color\\n\\nTableau doesn't always render color values exactly the same as a web browser would.\\nBut for consistency we still use all the same colors from the [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations/color) for colors in Tableau.\\nSpecific color usage information can be found throughout the style guide and within the template.\\nFor information related to the use of color in data visualizations, refer to the [charts section](/analytics/tableau-charts).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Customer Branding\\n\\nHealth Catalyst regards our analytic accelerators as products every bit as much as our web applications.\\nAs with our web applications, we allow our products to be co-branded, but not white-labeled.\\nCustomers may incorporate their logo into the navbar ([same as our web applications](/web/components/navbar/examples?section=navbar-cobrand)),\\nbut any Health Catalyst brand elements (colors, fonts, logos, etc) should not be removed or altered.\\n\\nRefer to the [navbar section](/analytics/tableau-navbar) section for more information about adding a customer's logo to your Tableau app's navbar.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Layout\\n\\nThe standard size for a Health Catalyst Tableau application is **1280 x 900** pixels.\\nWithin that space, the layout is divided into three primary areas: Navbar, Sidebar, and Content Area.\\nNote that if content needs to be further subdivided within the content area, [Tabs](/analytics/tableau-tabs) may be included in that space.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Layout Elements](./assets/analytics/tableau/layoutelements.png \\\"Layout Elements\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Navbar\\n\\nThe navbar is a horizontal container with a fixed 50px height.\\nDetailed information on the navbar and how to configure it is included in the [navbar section](/analytics/tableau-navbar).\\n\\n### Sidebar\\n\\nThe sidebar is a vertical container with a fixed 250px width.\\nIt typically contains filters, but can also be used as an information panel.\\nDetails about use of the sidebar can be found in the [filters section](/analytics/tableau-filters) and [about section](/analytics/tableau-about).\\n\\n### Content Area\\n\\nThe background color for the content area can be one of the following values:\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-100 `#f0f3f6`\\n- **Background**: white `#ffffff`\\n\\nThe Inner Padding for the content area on dashboards should be at least `20, 20, 20, 10`.\\nNote that the content area on the [About Page](/analytics/tableau-about) applies padding to the contained items instead.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Tiles\\n\\nAs with Cashmere web applications, content is typically contained within [tiles](/web/components/tile).\\nUnfortunately Tableau does not support rounded edges or drop-shadows, so tiles within Tableau apps will look slightly different than their Cashmere counterparts.\\nLayout specifics for the most common tiles can be found in the [KPI Metrics section](/analytics/tableau-metrics), [Charts section](/analytics/tableau-charts), and [Tables section](/analytics/tableau-tables). Refer to the template or these sections for working examples.\\n\\nIn general, a Tableau tile is a vertical container formatted with the following values:\\n- **Background**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Border style**: solid\\n- **Border**: slate-gray-300 `#c0c5cc`\\n\\nTiles should have at least 10px of padding between each other (5px on either side).\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Tableau Tiles](./assets/analytics/tableau/tiles.png \\\"Tableau Tiles\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Tile Header\\n\\nEvery tile should include a header horizontal container with a title, an info button, and a drill-down button (optional).\\n\\nThe header container is formatted as follows:\\n- **Height**: 35px\\n- **Padding (outer)**: `10, 5, 10, 0`\\n\\nThe header text should be\\n- **Font**: Tableau Bold,\\n- **Color**: offblack `#333333`\\n- **Size**: 10pt\\n\\nFor the info tooltip, we leverage a worksheet with a shape.\\nThe shape used is included in the folder called \\\"HealthCatalystShapes\\\" in the template zip file.\\nCopy the HealthCatalystShapes folder to Documents/My Tableau Repository/Shapes folder.\\n\\nDuplicate one of the existing tooltip worksheets from the template to ensure consistent sizing of the button.\\nFrom the worksheet, click the Tooltip button in the *Marks* panel.\\nThere you can edit the information you'd like to appear in the tooltip.\\nBack on the dashboard, drag the duplicated tooltip sheet to the header horizontal container.\\nHide the title of the sheet, remove all outer padding, and set the fixed width to 30px.\\nFinally, set the inner padding to `0, 3, 0, 0` to adjust the vertical position.\\n\\n![Header Tooltip](./assets/analytics/tableau/tooltipsheet.png \\\"Header Tooltip\\\")\\n\\nUse of the drill-down function will be specific to your application.\\nIn general, it should allow the user to explore raw data used to calculate the metric or data visualization.\\nThey may mean using a navigation button, or a worksheet as with the info button.\\nFor a worksheet, follow the same steps above but swap the shape to the query button within HealthCatalystShapes.\\nFor a navigation button, remove all outer padding, set the fixed width to 30px, and then set the inner padding to 5px on all sides.\\n\\n### Divider\\n\\nA horizontal line divides the header from the content of the tile and is formatted as follows:\\n- **Weight**: 1px\\n\\nAdd a blank item to the tile vertical container and format it with the following values:\\n- **Padding (outer)**: `10, 0, 10, 5`\\n- **Height**: 6px\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-300 `#c0c5cc`\\n\\n### Content\\n\\nThe remaining area of the tile can be used for any type of content.\\nRefer to the other sections of this style guide for details about specific types of tiles such as KPI Metrics, charts, and tables.\\n\\n:::\\n\";","import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';\nimport {ApplicationInsights} from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-web';\nimport {environment} from 'src/environments/environment';\n\n@Injectable({\n    providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class ApplicationInsightsService {\n    private appInsights;\n\n    constructor() {\n        // Fail gracefully if an application insights key is not provided\n        if ('instrumentationKey' in environment) {\n            this.appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({\n                config: {\n                    instrumentationKey: environment['instrumentationKey']\n                }\n            });\n\n            this.appInsights.loadAppInsights();\n        }\n    }\n\n    logPageView(name?: string, uri?: string) {\n        if ('instrumentationKey' in environment) {\n            this.appInsights.trackPageView({name, uri});\n        }\n    }\n\n    logEvent(trigger: string, target: string) {\n        if ('instrumentationKey' in environment) {\n            this.appInsights.trackEvent({name: 'Example Click', properties: {example: trigger, target: target}});\n        }\n    }\n}\n","export default \"# Health Catalyst Technical Director\\n\\n###### Last updated Nov 30, 2020\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<div class=\\\"persona-header\\\">\\n\\n![Avatar Image](./assets/avatars/avatar6.svg)\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n# Kiri Hwan\\n\\n### Technical Director\\n\\nKiri develops and executes strategies of implementing proprietary data warehousing solutions and manages expectations with dynamic timelines.

A secondary metric should be formatted as:\\n- **Font**: Tableau Book\\n- **Font size**: 10pt\\n- **Font color**: offblack `#333333`\\n\\nArrows or text colors indicating positive trends should be set to\\n- **Color**: green `#00a859`\\n\\nFor negative trends, use\\n- **Color**: red `#f13c45`\\n\\nBut never rely solely on color to indicate a positive or negative trend, either text or iconography should also indicate the trend.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Info Tooltip\\n\\nEvery KPI metric should include an info tooltip in its header.\\nRefer to the [Foundations section](/analytics/tableau-foundations) for information on how to configure it.\\nThe info tooltip should provide a description of specifically what the metric is meant to indicate, and how it is calculated (equations can be useful).\\n\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Drill-down\\n\\nA drill-down button should generally be included with every KPI metric header as well.\\nThe purpose of the drill-down button is to allow the user to look into the raw data used to calculate the metric.\\nIt serves as an opportunity for validation and additional exploration.\\nMost accelerators will want to include a \\\"Measure Explorer\\\" page similar to that of our decision support application, [Leading Wisely](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/product/leading-wisely/).\\nThe Measure Explorer tab is what the KPI drill-down will typically link to with the particular metric selected.\\nRefer to the template for an example implementation of a Measure Explorer page.\\n\\n:::\\n\";","import { Component, Input, ViewChild, OnInit, ViewContainerRef, ComponentFactoryResolver } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { titleCase } from 'change-case';\nimport stackblitz from '@stackblitz/sdk';\nimport { EXAMPLE_COMPONENTS } from '@healthcatalyst/cashmere-examples';\nimport { ApplicationInsightsService } from '../../../../shared/application-insights/application-insights.service';\nimport { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';\nimport { TabSetComponent } from 'projects/cashmere/src/lib/tabs';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'hc-example-viewer',\n    templateUrl: 'example-viewer.component.html',\n    styleUrls: ['example-viewer.component.scss']\n})\nexport class ExampleViewerComponent implements OnInit {\n    @ViewChild('exampleContainer', { read: ViewContainerRef, static: true })\n    exampleContainer: ViewContainerRef;\n    @ViewChild('tabSet') _tabSet: TabSetComponent;\n\n    isInitialized = false;\n    private _example: string;\n    private allExampleFiles: FileHash = {};\n    private appInsights;\n    private selected: string;\n    private section: string;\n    exampleFiles: Array<{ name: string; contents: string }> = [];\n\n    constructor(\n        private httpClient: HttpClient,\n        private componentFactoryResolver: ComponentFactoryResolver,\n        private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute\n    ) {\n        this.appInsights = new ApplicationInsightsService();\n        this.activatedRoute.queryParams.subscribe(params => {\n            if (params['selected']) {\n                this.selected = params['selected'];\n            }\n            if (params['section']) {\n                this.section = params['section'];\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    @Input()\n    get example() {\n        return this._example;\n    }\n    set example(example: string) {\n        this._example = example;\n        if (example && this.isInitialized) {\n            this.loadExample();\n        }\n    }\n\n    get exampleTitle() {\n        return titleCase(this._example);\n    }\n\n    async ngOnInit() {\n        if (this.example) {\n            await this.loadExample();\n            this.isInitialized = true;\n\n            setTimeout(() => {\n                if (this.selected && this._example === this.section) {\n                    const found = this._tabSet._tabs.toArray().find(t => t.tabTitle === this.selected);\n                    this._tabSet.selectTab(found ?

Help us maximize the effort we spend fixing issues and adding new features by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information increases the chances your issue is dealt with quickly:\\n\\n-   **Overview of the issue**. If an error is being thrown, a non-minified stack trace helps.\\n-   **Angular and Cashmere version**. Note which versions are affected.\\n-   **Motivation or use case**. Explain what you are trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you.\\n-   **Browsers and operating systems**. Answer \\\"Is this a problem with all browsers?\\\"\\n-   **Reproduce the error**. Provide a live example (using CodePen, JsBin, Plunker, etc.) or a unambiguous set of steps.\\n-   **Screenshots**. Due to the visual nature of Cashmere, screenshots help the team triage issues far more quickly than a text description.\\n-   **Related issues**. Answer \\\"Has a similar issue been reported before?\\\"\\n-   **Suggest a fix**. If you can't fix the bug yourself, point to what might be causing the problem (e.g., a line of code or commit).\\n\\nEven better, submit a pull request with a fix!\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Want a Feature?\\n\\nRequest a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HealthCatalyst/Fabric.Cashmere/issues).

But within the house brand, apps still need a way\n            to be clearly distinguished from one another. The product icon, along with the Flexo font version\n            of its name (used in the navbar) are the two unique visual identifiers for an app.  They are to be used in\n            all promotional or training materials related to the app, as well as any websites that reference the app\n            (Health Catalyst Community, Docs, etc).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Click any of the icons below to download a zip containing an SVG and PNG of that icon.

       <p>\n            When symbols are needed, Health Catalyst makes use of two icon font families. First is <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Font Awesome</a>,\n            an industry standard for common UI iconography. And second is our custom HC Icons font,\n            which acts as a complement to Font Awesome and provides a standard visual language around concepts\n            frequently used in our applications.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The purpose of Health Catalyst’s icon set is to provide a standard visual language around concepts frequently used in our\n            applications.  For an optimal user experience, any time elements like data marts, bindings, or columns appear, they should\n            be represented the same way – regardless of the application.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Note that Cashmere does not have a dependency on any icon font.\n            Any glyphs that are used in the components have been base64 encoded into the component’s styles.\n

in your Angular web app.\n            If you're working on a project that isn't using sass, but can still pull the Cashmere npm package, a css file is also included:<br>\n

By adding new and exciting components to this library you are only enriching what it has to offer to it's developers. Here are some things to remember when creating new components.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Creating the Component Manually\\n\\n<strong>1.</strong> Start by creating a new folder for your component in `projects/cashmere/src/lib`. This folder should contain the following files:\\n\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".directive.ts**\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".component.spec.ts**\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".component.ts**\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".html**\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".module.ts** - this file exports all the public properties of your component.\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".scss** - this will be used to style your component. For more on how to follow our styling conventions, see the [Customizing Components](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/web/guides/using-customizing-components?section=style-guidelines-for-new-components&selected=using-customizing-components) guide\\n- **\\\"index\\\".ts** - this file exports all the public properties of your component.\\n\\n<strong>2.</strong> Import & export your new `\\\"component-name\\\".module.ts` in `src/app/shared/cashmere.module.ts`\\n\\n<strong>3.</strong> Export your component's `index.ts` file from `projects/cashmere/src/public_api.ts`\\n\\n<strong>4.</strong> Create examples - see the [Working with Examples](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/web/guides/working-with-examples) guide\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Creating the Component With Commands\\n\\n<strong>1.</strong> Start by openining the directory where you want the new component `projects/cashmere/src/lib`\\n\\n<strong>2.</strong> Run the comand `ng generate component \\\"component-name\\\"`. Executing the command creates a folder, \\\"component-name\\\", in the project's `projects/cashmere/src/lib` path.The folder has the following files:\\n\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".component.ts**\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".component.css**\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".component.html**\\n- **\\\"component-name\\\".component.spec.ts**\\n- **index.ts**\\n\\n<strong>3.</strong> Create the ```\\\"component-name.module\\\".ts``` file.\\n\\n<strong>4.</strong> Import & export your new ```\\\"component-name\\\".module.ts``` in ```src/app/shared/cashmere.module.ts```\\n\\n<strong>5.</strong> Export your component's ```index.ts``` file from ```projects/cashmere/src/public_api.ts```\\n\\n<strong>6.</strong> Create examples - see the [Working with Examples](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/web/guides/working-with-examples) guide\\n\\n:::\\n\";","<div class=\"demo-content\">\n    <div [hcMarkdown]=\"document\" (loaded)=\"loaded()\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"error-tile\">\n    <div class=\"about-modal-content\">\n        <div class=\"about-header\">\n            <img src=\"./assets/HealthCatalyst_Horizontal.svg\" class=\"about-logo\" alt=\"\" />\n            <div class=\"about-app\">\n                <div class=\"about-icon\">\n                    <img src=\"./assets/CashmereIcon.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"about-name\">\n                    <img src=\"./assets/CashmereAppLogo.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n                    <div class=\"about-version\">\n                        Version 5.3.0.0\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"about-reference\">\n            <div>\n                <hc-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"fa-cloud\" hcIconLg></hc-icon>\n                <div>\n                    <strong>Web Server</strong>\n                    <div class=\"about-reference-detail\">HC2370</div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <hc-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"fa-server\" hcIconLg></hc-icon>\n                <div>\n                    <strong>Metadata Server</strong>\n                    <div class=\"about-reference-detail\">localhost</div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <hc-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"fa-database\" hcIconLg></hc-icon>\n                <div>\n                    <strong>Database Name</strong>\n                    <div class=\"about-reference-detail\">EDWAdmin</div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"about-footer\">\n            Copyright 2019 <a href=\"https://www.healthcatalyst.com/\">Health Catalyst</a>.

However, Power BI does not easily support embedding custom fonts, and we don't want to rely on users having these fonts installed. The following guidelines translate the Cashmere standard into a Power BI-friendly format:\\n\\n### App Name\\n\\nUse of the Flexo font in the Health Catalyst brand is generally limited to logos and app names. In the Power BI template, we only feature it in the app name on the navbar. The font is baked into an image so there is no type dependency. Information on obtaining a logo image for your app can be found on in the [navbar section](/analytics/powerbi-navbar).\\n\\n### Primary Font\\n\\nHealth Catalyst's primary font is Open Sans - a clean, readable, sans-serif typeface.\\nAlthough Power BI doesn't easily allow us to use Open Sans, it does come packaged with a very similar typeface called *Segoe* which includes several weight variations. Because Power BI doesn't consistently provide access to formatting options such as bolding,\\nin Health Catalyst Power BI applications, we leverage **Segoe UI**, **Segoe (Bold)**, and **Segoe UI Light**.\\nInformation about specific font sizes and weights can be found throughout this style guide, and examples of correct usage can be found in the template.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">\\n\\n![Segoe UI](/assets/analytics/powerbi/segoe_ui_01.png \\\"Segoe Typeface\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Icons\\nIcons should come from Health Catalyst's [icon set](https://cashmere.healthcatalyst.net/styles/icons) and should be sized similarly to adjacent text.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Color\\n\\nPower BI doesn't always render color values exactly the same as a web browser would.\\nBut for consistency we still use all the same colors from the [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations/color) for colors in Power BI.\\nSpecific color usage information can be found throughout the style guide, within the template's object visuals, and in the underlying JSON theme code packaged with the template.\\nFor information related to the use of color in data visualizations, refer to the [charts section](/analytics/powerbi-charts).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Customer Branding\\n\\nHealth Catalyst regards our analytic accelerators as products every bit as much as our web applications.\\nAs with our web applications, we allow our products to be co-branded, but not white-labeled.\\nCustomers may incorporate their logo into the navbar ([same as our web applications](/web/components/navbar/examples?section=navbar-cobrand)),\\nbut any Health Catalyst brand elements (colors, fonts, logos, etc) should not be removed or altered.\\n\\nRefer to the [navbar section](/analytics/powerbi-navbar) section for more information about adding a customer's logo to your Power BI app's navbar.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Layout\\n\\nThe standard aspect ratio for a Health Catalyst Power BI application is **16:9**.\\nWithin that space, the layout is divided into four primary areas: Navbar, Subnav, Content Area, and Filters.\\nNote that if content needs to be further subdivided within the content area, [Tabs](/analytics/powerbi-tabs) may be included in that space.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Layout Elements](./assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-layoutelements.png \\\"Layout Elements\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Navbar\\n\\nThe navbar is a horizontal text object with a fixed 50px height.\\nDetailed information on the navbar and how to configure it is included in the [navbar section](/analytics/powerbi-navbar).\\n\\n### Subnav\\n\\nThe subnav is used as an information panel to display dashboard-wide metrics, such as refresh timestamps or \\\"stickied\\\" metrics, such as population counts.\\n\\nFormat the subnav with the following parameters:\\n- **Type**: Text object\\n- **Height**: 30px\\n- **Width**: 1280px\\n- **Position**: `x:0, y:50`\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-400 `#708090`\\n- **Visual header toggle**: Off\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Static Bar](./assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-subnav.png \\\"Subnav\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Content Area\\n\\nOptions for a background color for the content area are:\\n- **Background option**: slate-gray-100 `#f0f3f6`\\n- **Background option**: white `#ffffff`\\n\\nObjects in the content area should be placed about 30px from the outer edges.\\n\\n### Filters\\n\\nInformation about the dynamic filters pane is included in the [filters section](/analytics/powerbi-filters).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Tiles\\n\\nVisualization objects such as charts, graphs, tables, and KPIs should be styled like the Cashmere [tile component](/web/components/tile) and will be referred to as tiles within this section.\\n\\nIn general, a Power BI tile is formatted accordingly:\\n\\n- **Background**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Border**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Border radius**: 5px\\n- **Padding**: At least 10px of padding between each tile (5px on either side)\\n\\n\\nEach tile should also have shadow with the following values:\\n- **Color**: black `#000000`\\n- **Shadow position**: Outside\\n- **Preset**: Custom\\n- **Size**: 1px\\n- **Blur**: 3px\\n- **Angle**: 90º\\n- **Distance**: 1px\\n- **Transparency**: 85%\\n\\nLayout specifics for the most common visual objects can be found in the [KPI Metrics section](/analytics/powerbi-metrics), [Charts section](/analytics/powerbi-charts), and [Tables section](/analytics/powerbi-tables). Refer to the template or these sections for working examples.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Power BI Tiles](./assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-tile.png \\\"Power BI Tiles\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Alignment\\nTiles should be evenly aligned horizontally and/or vertically\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![correct alignment](/assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-align.png \\\"Correct Alignment\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nTiles should not be distributed unevenly\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![incorrect alignment](/assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-align-wrong.png \\\"Incorrect Alignment\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nUtilize Power BI's alignment capabilities by selecting each object and choosing the appropriate distribution option within the *Align* section under the *Format* toolbar\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![alignment toolbar](/assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-align-how.png \\\"How To Align\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Tile Title\\n\\nEvery tile should include title with the following formatting:\\n- **Alignment**: left-aligned\\n- **Font**: Segoe UI\\n- **Font color**: offblack `#333333`\\n- **Font size**: 10pt\\n\\n### Tile Visual Header\\n\\nEvery tile should always include the info and filter icons within the visual header.\\nIcon color should be **slate-gray-400**`#708090`.\\n\\nSome header elements, such as drill-down icons, are object-specific and more details can be found in the [KPI Metrics section](/analytics/powerbi-metrics), [Charts section](/analytics/powerbi-charts), and [Tables section](/analytics/powerbi-tables). Refer to the template or these sections for working examples.\\n\\n### Divider\\n\\nA horizontal line divides the header from the content of the visual object. Leave about 2px of space on the left and right and format accordingly:\\n- **Weight**: 1pt\\n- **Height**: 12px\\n- **Color**: slate-gray-300 `#c0c5cc`\\n- **Visual header toggle**: Off\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![divider](/assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-chart-colors.png \\\"Power BI Divider\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Content\\n\\nThe remaining area of the tile can be used for any type of content.\\nRefer to the other sections of this style guide for details about specific types of tiles such as [KPI metrics](/analytics/powerbi-metrics), [charts](/analytics/powerbi-charts), and [tables](/analytics/powerbi-tables).\\n\\n:::\\n\";","import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Router } from '@angular/router';\nimport { Subscription } from 'rxjs';\nimport { DocItem } from '../../core/document-items.service';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'hc-component-viewer',\n    templateUrl: 'component-viewer.component.html',\n    styleUrls: ['component-viewer.component.scss']\n})\nexport class ComponentViewerComponent {\n    startSection = 0;\n    private _docItem: DocItem | undefined;\n    @Input()\n    get docItem(): DocItem | undefined {\n        return this._docItem;\n    }\n    set docItem(value: DocItem | undefined) {\n        this._docItem = value;\n        this.loadDocs();\n    }\n    sections: Set<string>;\n\n    constructor(private router: Router) {}\n\n    private loadDocs() {\n        this.startSection = 0;\n        let availableSections: string[] = [];\n\n        if (this.docItem) {\n            const examples = this.docItem.examples;\n            const urlArray = this.router.url.split('/');\n            if (examples && examples.length > 0) {\n                availableSections = ['Examples'];\n            }\n            if (!this.docItem.hideApi) {\n                availableSections.push('API');\n                if ( urlArray[ urlArray.length - 1 ].startsWith('api') ) {\n                    this.startSection = availableSections.length - 1;\n                }\n            }\n            if (this.docItem.usageDoc) {\n                availableSections.push('Usage');\n                if ( urlArray[ urlArray.length - 1 ].startsWith('usage') ) {\n                    this.startSection = availableSections.length - 1;\n                }\n            }\n\n            this.sections = new Set<string>(availableSections);\n        }\n    }\n}\n","import {Component, OnDestroy} from '@angular/core';\nimport {GuidesService, IGuide} from './guides.service';\nimport {ActivatedRoute, NavigationEnd, Router} from '@angular/router';\nimport {takeUntil} from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport {Subject} from 'rxjs';\nimport {ApplicationInsightsService} from '../shared/application-insights/application-insights.service';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'hc-guides',\n    templateUrl: './guides.component.html',\n    styleUrls: ['../shared/base-demo.component.scss']\n})\nexport class GuidesComponent implements OnDestroy {\n    thisPage = '';\n    queryTab = 0;\n\n    private unsubscribe = new Subject<void>();\n    private appInsights;\n\n    constructor(public guidesService: GuidesService, private router: Router, private route: ActivatedRoute) {\n        this.appInsights = new ApplicationInsightsService();\n        // Listen for vertical tab bar navigation and update the select component\n        this.router.events.pipe(takeUntil(this.unsubscribe)).subscribe(event => {\n            if (event instanceof NavigationEnd) {\n                for (let entry of this.guidesService.guides) {\n                    if (event.urlAfterRedirects === `/web/guides/${entry.route}`) {\n                        this.thisPage = entry.title;\n                        this.appInsights.logPageView(this.thisPage, event.urlAfterRedirects);\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        });\n\n        //  Gets the search parameter value from the url\n        this.route.queryParams.subscribe(() => {\n            let currentPath = this.router.url;\n            currentPath = currentPath.replace( '/web/guides/', '' );\n            const pathArray = currentPath.split( '?' );\n\n            for ( let i = 0;

Card visuals are used to display items that rely upon data fields (such as a last refresh date).\\nExamples are included in the template, but they may be edited or removed as needed.\\n\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Content Area\\n\\nThe Content Area has a **white** `#ffffff RGB(255,255,255)` background for the About Page.\\n\\nThe first item in the Content Area is the full Health Catalyst horizontal logo:\\n- **Location**: x:514, y:87\\n- **Height**: 146px\\n- **Width**: 463px\\n- **Scale**: Normal\\n- **Image stretch**: Aspect lock on\\n\\nThe second item in the content area is a banner with the name of the accelerator.

The styles presented here don't seek to rewrite any of those books, but instead are primarily aimed at maximizing readability and consistency in our charts. But if you are looking for an excellent, no-nonsense guide for improving your visualizations, we highly recommend Scott Berinato's [Good Charts](http://a.co/9uDIcKr).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Layout\\n\\n![Chart Example](./assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-chart.png \\\"Chart Example\\\")\\n\\nCharts follow all the general standards for tiles as defined in the [Foundations section](/analytics/qlik-foundations).\\nRefer to that **Tile Visual Header** and **Divider** sections of that page for specific parameters to apply to the top of the chart tile.\\n\\nIf a subheader or additional controls are needed for a chart, they should be the next item under the header divider.\\n\\nThe content of the chart appears in the area below.\\n\\nThe exact size of a tile for a chart will be determined by the other content that has to fit on the page and what is required for readability of the data.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Grid Styles\\n\\nAxis lines within charts should be formatted as:\\n- **Weight**: 1px\\n- **Color**: off-black `#333333 RGB(51,51,51)`\\n\\nAxis labels should be formatted as:\\n- **Font**: Arial, 9pt\\n- **Font color**: off-black `#333333 RGB(51,51,51)`\\n\\nGrid lines should be formatted as:\\n- **Weight**: 1px\\n- **Color**: gray-300 `#cccccc RGB(204,204,204)`\\n- **Style**: Dotted\\n\\n![Grid Lines](./assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-gridlines.png \\\"Grid Lines\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Data Colors\\n\\nTo determine what colors should be used together in charts, you should determine what the data is trying to convey. If it’s a normal reporting chart for general use, blues and cool colors should be used to keep consistency. Refer to the colors in [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations/color) for options that fit within our Health Catalyst palette. Grays should be used for either showing a benchmark or previous years to contrast the difference of the current year.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![data colors](/assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-chart.png \\\"Qlik Chart\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nCharts that are dense, complex, and/or require specialized knowledge or experience to comprehend are well-suited for review by both Health Catalyst's data science team and design teams to ensure that visual elements such as color saturation, line thickness, shapes, label placements, etc., are crafted to best support the data story.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Hover States\\n\\nThe specific content of tooltips of the chart will be dictated by the data being displayed.\\nBut in general, they should contain a label and a value.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![tooltip](/assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-tooltip.png \\\"Qlik Tooltip\\\")\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Visual Header Tooltips\\n\\nCharts should include tooltips that enable and enhance self-service analytics and data exploration.\\n\\n### Info Tooltip\\n\\nCharts should usually include a help tooltip icon in the header. Edit the help text within the **Caption** tab in chart properties.\\n\\nRefer to the [Foundations section](/analytics/qlik-foundations) for information on how to configure it.\\nThe info tooltip should provide a longer description of what is being visualized on the chart, how it should read, and any considerations when evaluating it.\\nIf additional controls are included above the chart, the info tooltip can also provide instructions on how to interact with the chart.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Info Tooltips](./assets/analytics/qlik/qlik-info.png \\\"Info Tooltips\\\")\\n</div>\\n\\n### Data Tooltips\\n\\nEvery chart should include the **Send to Excel** icon to enable power users who may want to explore the raw data. Some other special icons provide users with features such as the ability to easily copy the visualization as an image, to clear any filters, etc. Use your best judgement to carefully choose the most effective header icons for a chart, while weighing the potentially overwhelming effect that providing too many options brings.\\n\\n:::\\n\";","import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {SharedModule} from '../shared/shared.module';\nimport {StylesRoutesModule} from './styles-routes.module';\nimport {ApplicationInsightsService} from '../shared/application-insights/application-insights.service';\nimport {StylesComponent} from './styles.component';\nimport {AboutModalComponent} from './about/about-modal.component';\nimport {TableDemoComponent} from './table/table-demo.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [SharedModule, StylesRoutesModule],\n    providers: [ApplicationInsightsService],\n    declarations: [\n        StylesComponent,\n        AboutModalComponent,\n        TableDemoComponent\n    ]\n})\nexport class StylesModule {}\n","export default \"# Cost Analyst/Accountant\\n\\n###### Last updated Nov 30, 2020\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<div class=\\\"persona-header\\\">\\n\\n![Avatar Image](./assets/avatars/avatar79.svg)\\n\\n<div>\\n\\n# Aaron Parano\\n\\n### Cost Analyst, Cost Accountant, Analytics Engineer\\n\\nAaron performs validations to resolve configuration and data quality discrepancies.

She is a primarily consumer of data, not a creator.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Goals\\n\\n- Demonstrate that the domain area program is viable (through ROI). This may include:\\n    - Looking for opportunities to improve margin by identifying and targeting inappropriate utilization\\n    - Looking for opportunities to increase reimbursement for care\\n- Optimize organizational performance in a strategic, balanced, and timely way\\n- Review the quality of her team’s work and coach/mentor her team by identifying and sharing best practices. Depending on the executive focus, this may include attention to:\\n    - Appropriate care and overuse\\n    - Effective operational or workflow management\\n    - Effective purchasing or revenue recognition\\n- Identify additional opportunities for managing patients, with regard to more optimal utilization pathways, more effective payer relationships, etc.\\n- Improve quality of patient care (improve outcomes)\\n- Decrease patient costs (optimize utilization)\\n- Improve the patient experience\\n- Increase provider engagement and experience\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Needs\\n\\n-   Measure program or organizational performance—process and outcome measures, variation between staff (for reporting to leadership, identifying training needs, etc.)—and quickly identify meaningful changes\\n-   Insight into drivers of outcomes (positive or negative) and the ability to communicate clearly and credibly with others in the organization about the opportunity to improve performance (single source of truth)\\n-   Benchmark organizational performance against national standards or other organizations\\n-   Analyze the domain area population for problems and opportunities for improvement (for example, to reduce costs, improve care, reduce utilization, etc.)\\n-   Track costs trends over time and identify the root cause of changes in cost trends\\n-   Review specific patients to identify gaps in care related to domain area\\n\\n:::\\n\";","<hc-tile>\n    <div class=\"header\">\n        <h3 [id]=\"exampleTitle | changeCase: 'paramCase'\" hcTileHeader>{{ exampleTitle }}</h3>\n

We aim to provide flexibility to application developers to use all the latest Angular features; at the same time, we don't want to leave applications behind by only targeting bleeding-edge versions.  Therefore, we take the following balanced approach for Angular versioning in Cashmere:\\n\\n### Target: latest LTS version\\n\\nWe plan to keep Cashmere up-to-date with the latest LTS version of Angular.  This means that when an Angular version ends active support and enters LTS support (see [Angular's Support Policy and Schedule](https://angular.io/guide/releases#support-policy-and-schedule)), Cashmere will update its minimum supported version to that version.\\n\\n#### Hypothetical Example\\n\\nIf the current support table on angular.io looks like this:\\n\\n| VERSION  | STATUS | RELEASED     | ACTIVE ENDS  | LTS ENDS     |\\n| :------- | :----- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------- |\\n| ^79.0.0  | Active | Feb 06, 2120 | Aug 06, 2120 | Aug 06, 2121 |\\n| ^78.0.0  | LTS    | May 28, 2119 | Nov 28, 2119 | Nov 28, 2120 |\\n\\nCashmere would be updated to target Angular versions on this schedule:\\n\\n* **Angular 78**: November 28, 2119\\n* **Angular 79**: August 6, 2120\\n\\n### Latest Angular is always supported\\n\\nEven though Cashmere currently _targets_ Angular version `n`, we aim to make it compatible with all released versions `>n` as well.  In the example above, you don't have to wait until August 6, 2120 to upgrade from Angular 78 to 79.  We encourage all teams to keep up to date with the latest Angular version as much as possible.\\n\\nIf you find any incompatibilites with the latest Angular version, please log an issue.\\n\\n:::\\n\";","export default \"# Supported Browsers\\n\\n###### Last updated March 13, 2018\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Browser support table\\n\\nTo support a more unified and better user experience, Health Catalyst should aim to align the target browser compatibility.

2021\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Overview\\n\\nFilters are a foundational element of any analytics accelerator.\\nThey allow users to more deeply investigate the cause of trends or finds areas for improvement.\\nBut filters can be a double-edged sword, because they can also add significant complexity to both the UI and UX of an accelerator.\\nAs a result, care must be taken in what filters are given prominence and how they are displayed.\\n\\nAnother important consideration with filters is ensuring that user has a clear understanding of what filters are currently active.\\nThe sidebar is always visible, so filters being used can be easily seen.\\n*Be careful about applying any filters that are not easily reset or not visible to the user.*\\n\\n![Filter Sidebar](./assets/analytics/tableau/filteroverview.png \\\"Filter Sidebar\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Sidebar\\n\\nFor consistency, filters should be displayed on the sidebar of the accelerator layout.\\n\\nA filter sidebar should be formatted as following:\\n- **Background**: slate-gray-400 `#708090`\\n- **Width**: 250px\\nThere should be 10px of vertical space at the top of the sidebar before the first filter or metric.\\n\\n### Counts\\n\\nFrequently it is useful for accelerators to a display a count of key metrics as part of the filter sidebar (e.g. Encounters, Unique Patients).\\nThis gives users a clear indication of the sample size being used to determine the values on their dashboard.\\nFor example, if they've filtered the sample size down too small, the values in the dashboard will no longer be useful.\\nAs many counts may be included as needed, one on top of the other.\\n\\n![Filter Counts](./assets/analytics/tableau/filtercounts.png \\\"Filter Counts\\\")\\n\\nThese counts should be the first item on the sidebar, and should displayed as a horizontal container with the label on the left and the value on the right.\\n\\nCounts labels are formatted as:\\n- **Font**: Tableau Regular, 10pt\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Padding (outer)**: `6, 4, 0, 4`\\n\\nCounts values are formatted as:\\n- **Font**: Tableau Bold, 17pt\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Padding (outer)**: `0, 0, 6, 0`\\n- **Alignment**: right-justified\\n\\n### Controls\\n\\nControl labels are formatted as follows:\\n- **Label**: Tableau Regular, 10pt\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n\\n\\nAll controls, regardless of type should have the following values:\\n- **Height**: 52px\\n- **Padding (outer)**: `8, 2, 8, 2`\\n\\n![Filter Control](./assets/analytics/tableau/filtercontrol.png \\\"Filter Control\\\")\\n\\n### Footer\\n\\nAs with counts, most accelerators benefit from including a footer indicating the last refresh of the data.\\nThis gives users confidence that the values in the dashboard are current and valid.\\n\\nIn general, the footer should be set to\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Font (label)**: Tableau Regular, 9pt\\n- **Font (value)**: Tableau Bold, 11pt\\n- **Height**: 55px\\n- **Padding (outer)**: `4, 4, 4, 4`\\n\\n![Filter Footer](./assets/analytics/tableau/filterfooter.png \\\"Filter Footer\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Filter Scope\\n\\nIt is often worth dividing filters on the sidebar by their scope.\\nSome filters, when set, should carry across application from one section to the next.\\nThese should be referred to as **App Filters** and should be visible in the sidebar of every page.\\n\\nOther filters may only apply to the specific section the user is viewing, and will not carry over to other pages.\\nThese are referred to as **Page Filters**.\\n\\nTo distinguish between these filter types, we use section headers on the sidebar.\\n\\nSection headers are text items set to the following values:\\n- **Font**: Tableau Bold\\n- **Font size**: 10pt\\n- **Font color**: white `#ffffff`\\n- **Height**: 26px\\n- **Background**: charcoal-blue `#384655`\\n- **Padding (inner)**: `6, 5, 0, 6`\\n\\nThere should also be a 10px height spacer after the header.\\n\\n![Filter Header](./assets/analytics/tableau/filtersection.png \\\"Filter Header\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Advanced Filters\\n\\n![Advanced Filters](./assets/analytics/tableau/advancedfilters.png \\\"Advanced Filters\\\")\\n\\nThe sidebar filters should be the primary mechanic for filtering that most users leverage.\\nHowever, there may be power users of your accelerator who require the ability to define more precise or detailed cohorts.\\nFor those users, you may want to include an \\\"Advanced Filters\\\" page that includes a wider array of filter options.\\n\\nFrom a UX perspective, the risk with a page like this is that a user will define filters and then forget they turned them on.\\nThat's why we want to limit this page primarily to power users.\\nYou can link to it via an icon in the navbar (use the *AdvancedFilters.svg* image included with the template), which keeps it somewhat hidden for typical users.\\n\\nOn the Advanced Filters page, arrange the available filters into tiles as defined in the [Foundations

The styles presented here don't seek to rewrite any of those books, but instead are primarily aimed at maximizing readability and consistency in our charts. But if you are looking for an excellent, no-nonsense guide for improving your visualizations, we highly recommend Scott Berinato's [Good Charts](http://a.co/9uDIcKr).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Layout\\n\\n![Chart Example](./assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-chart-colors.png \\\"Chart Example\\\")\\n\\nCharts follow all the general standards for tiles as defined in the [Foundations section](/analytics/powerbi-foundations).\\nRefer to that **Tile Visual Header** and **Divider** sections of that page for specific parameters to apply to the top of the chart tile.\\n\\nIf a subheader or additional controls are needed for a chart, they should be the next item under the header divider.\\n\\nThe content of the chart appears in the area below.\\n\\nThe exact size of a tile for a chart will be determined by the other content that has to fit on the page and what is required for readability of the data.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Grid Styles\\n\\nAxis lines in charts are set to the following values:\\n- **Weight**: 1px\\n- **Color**: offblack `#333333`\\n- **Label font**: Segoe UI, 9pt\\n- **Label font color**: offblack `#333333`\\n\\nGride lines are set to the following values:\\n- **Weight**: 1px\\n- **Style**: Dotted\\n- **Color**: gray-300 `#cccccc`\\n\\n![Grid Lines](./assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-grid-lines.png \\\"Grid Lines\\\")\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::\\n\\n##### Data Colors\\n\\nTo determine what colors should be used together in charts, you should determine what the data is trying to convey. If it’s a normal reporting chart for general use, blues and cool colors should be used to keep consistency. Refer to the colors in [Cashmere Foundations](/foundations/color) for options that fit within our Health Catalyst palette.

Some hovers allow for data drilling (e.g., clicking into a single month) while others enable data expansion (e.g., viewing 12 months of data for a given year). Use your best judgement to carefully choose the most effective header icons for a chart, while weighing the potentially overwhelming effect that providing too many options brings.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><br>\\n\\n![Drill Tooltips](./assets/analytics/powerbi/pbi-drilldown-on.png \\\"Drill Tooltips\\\")\\n</div>\\n\\n:::\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":"webpack:///"}
